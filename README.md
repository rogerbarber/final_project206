Using Spotify API, we will attempt to draw a connection between lyrics used and various audio features tracked by Spotify's API on the Billboard Top 100 songs.
These features include metrics such as danceability, key, energy, acousticness, vocalness.
We will cross reference from Genius lyrics to track the amount of certain word usage in the top 100 songs to find if there is a correlation between usage of certain keywords
and popularity, or if using certain words influences the Spotify audio feature metrics.
